## Assignment 1: Git Readme

### Websites vs Web Applications

Websites are primarily designed for informational purposes, focusing on presenting content to users in a static and browseable manner. Examples include blogs, news portals, and organization sites. Websites rely on:

HTML for structure.

CSS for styling.

JavaScript for interactivity.

Web Applications, on the other hand, are interactive and focus on functionality, allowing users to perform tasks or interact dynamically with data (e.g., Google Docs, Trello). These applications use the same core technologies as websites but often involve more complex frameworks.

### VS Code & Extensions

VS Code is a code editor for software development. Setting it up involves:

Installing the Editor: Download and install Visual Studio Code from its official website.

Adding Extensions: Enhance functionality using extensions such as:

Prettier: Code formatting tool.

Live Server: For live preview of web pages.

Auto Rename Tag: Automatically updates paired HTML tags.

Markdown Preview Enhanced: Previews Markdown documents with enhanced features.

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

Version Control is a system for tracking changes in code, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed.

Git is a popular version control tool:

Installed via package managers like Homebrew on macOS or direct downloads on Windows.

Configured using commands like git config --global user.name "Your Name" and git config --global user.email "Your Email".

GitHub is an platform for hosting repositories, enabling collaboration and remote code storage. Common tasks include:

Committing Changes: git commit -m "message" -m "description".

Pushing Changes: Synchronizing local updates to GitHub using git push.

Pulling Changes: Downloading updates from GitHub using git pull.

### Markdown & Documentation

Markdown is a simple lenguage to format plain text to HTML, using simple simbols and characters for formatting.Often used in documentation, readme files, forums and blogs.

Key features include:

Headings: # for H1, ## for H2, etc.

Text Formatting: **bold** or _italic_.

Lists: Ordered (1.) and unordered (-).

Links & Images: [text](url) and ![alt](url).

Code: Inline with backticks (`) and blocks with triple backticks (```).

Tables: Defined using pipes (|) and hyphens (-).

Blockquotes & Horizontal Rules: > for blockquotes, --- for separators.
