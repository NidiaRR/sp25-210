This assignment involves creating three different web pages for a music school and a photography studio. The task was to develop an instrument lesson booking system, a page for displaying student test scores, and an image gallery for a photography studio. Each page uses HTML for structure and JavaScript to handle dynamic content.

In the Instrument Lessons project, the goal was to create a page where students can view a list of available instruments for booking lessons. The JavaScript loops through an array of instruments and displays them on the page.

The Test Scores project required building a page that lists students' test scores and calculates the average score. The task here was to display each score and then calculate the average by adding the scores and dividing by the number of students.

In the Image Gallery project, the objective was to display images from a recent photoshoot. JavaScript was used to create image tags dynamically and add them to the page.

Overall, the assignment focused on using JavaScript to manipulate the HTML content dynamically and practice tasks like looping through data and updating the webpage based on that data.
